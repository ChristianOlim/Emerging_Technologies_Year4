# EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ASSIGNMENT 2019 - YEAR 4
## CHRISTIAN OLIM - G00334621



## QUESTION

This assessment concerns the well-known MNIST dataset and the Python packages
keras, flask, and jupyter. The project is worth 100% of your marks for this
module, but it is broken into three parts, as follows:



__PRESENTATION__

Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer to clone. The repository should contain all your work for this assessment.
In the last week of term, or otherwise as advised in class, you must demonstrate
your repository and its code to the lecturer. This part is worth 20% of your overall
mark.


__MODEL__

Create, document, and train a model that recognises hand-written digits
using the MNIST dataset. This should be done using the keras and jupyter Python
packages, and this part is worth 40%.



__APPLICATION__

Create a web application that allows a user to draw a digit using
their mouse or touchscreen device. The drawing should then be then be submitted
for recognition to the model you have trained above. This should be done using
the flask Python package and is also worth 40%.



## WHAT I USED AND INSTALLED TO MAKE THIS PROJECT

+ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
+ [Python with packages (Anaconda)](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
+ [Command Line (Cmder)](https://cmder.net/)
+ *Jupyter* - There are two options to run this which are __jupyter notebook__ and __jupyter lab__. You can use either of these on the Cmder command line but out of personal preference I used jupyter lab as I found it easier to use.
